Scenario,Network Topology,Control Objectives
theta,2 sq.km idealized separated stormwater network,Maintain the flows at the outlet below a threshold and avoid flooding (2 storage basin outlets)
alpha,0.12 sq.km residential combined sewer network,Minimize total combined sewer overflow volume (5 weirs at interceptor connections)
beta,1.3 sq.km separated stormwater network with a tidally-influenced receiving river,Minimize flooding (one storage basin outlet; one pump; one inline storage dam)
gamma,4 sq.km highly urban separated stormwater network,Maintain channel flows below threshold and avoid flooding (11 detention pond outlets)
delta,2.5 sq.km combined sewer network in which the stormwater ponds also serve as waterfront,Maintain water levels within upper and lower thresholds for water quality and aesthetic objectives (4 storage basin outlets; 1 infiltration basin inlet)
epsilon,67 sq.km highly urban combined sewer network,Maintain sewer network outlet total suspended solids (TSS) load below threshold and avoid flooding (11 in-line storage dams)
zeta,1.8 sq.km combined and separated sewer network (based on the Astlingen benchmarking network),Maximize flow to downstream wastewater treatment plant and minimize total combined sewer overflow volume (4 storage basin outlets)
