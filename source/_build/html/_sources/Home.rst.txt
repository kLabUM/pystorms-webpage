Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

This package can be installed using `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_. 

.. code:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/kLabUM/Benchmarking

**Requirements:**

* pyswmm 
* numpy 

Necessary requirements will be installed with the package. 
This package is supported on all operating systems and please refer to FAQ if you encounter any issues with installing.

Running a scenario
-------------------

There are five primary benchmarking scenarios available in the library.
You can build your own scenarios using the networks and rainfalls
available in the network. Please refer to building scenarios for more
details.

Each of five scenarios deal with a different stormwater issue. Please
refer to the paper for details on each scenario. Once a desired scenario
has been chosen, performance of the controller in this scenario can be
tested as followed.

.. code:: python

   import benchmarking

   # You do not have define this function !!!
   # You can do this in the loop. This is here to illustrate that a action 
   # is decided based on the state by the controller.  
   def controller(state):
       """
       Controller implementation that identifies a action based 
       on the state. 
       """
       return np.ones(11)

   env = benchmarking.scenarios.gamma()

   done = False 
   while not done:
       state = env.state()

       actions = controller(state)
       
       done = env.step(actions)
